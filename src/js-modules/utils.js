//This is a module for utility functions to be used 
//  in many other modules


//Make a function that creates, populates, and adds to the DOM a
//  list of tasks with the ability to add only a selection from 
//  the list. E.G only single projects or only group projects

//One way to do this - a second functional-programming/mixin style
// function that does the filter as an optional extra
